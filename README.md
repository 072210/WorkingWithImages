# WorkingWithImages

# Part 1: Basic images
Working with the BasicImages code, we will be loading and displaying images using PImage

# Part 2: Filtering
We will create a new branch called "Filtering images", and in the FilteringImages code, we will be looking at how we can use filters to affect the way an image is displayed. Don't forget to merge your filtering branch back into the master branch.

# Part 3: Masking
We will create a new branch called "Masking images", and in the MaskingImages code, we will be looking at how we can mask one image with another image. Don't forget to merge your masking branch back into the master branch.

# Part 4: Blending
We will create a new branch called "Blending images", and in the BlendingImages code, we will be looking at how we can blend two images together. Don't forget to merge your blending branch back into the master branch.

# Part 5: Independent Practice
Create something to show me that you understand how to work with images. I will be evaluating you based on correct use of images, correct coding in general (including comments), creativity, and how much you challenge yourself. Create a new branch and do this in the "IndependentImagePractice" file.
